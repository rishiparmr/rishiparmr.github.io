NODE VERSION NOTICE
===================

You are currently using Node.js 20.7.0.

Vite recommends Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+, but your current version 
should still work fine for development.

If you encounter any issues:

1. Update Node.js:
   - Using nvm: nvm install 20.19
   - Using Homebrew: brew upgrade node
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org

2. Or use an older Vite version:
   - npm install -D vite@5.0.0
   - npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-vue@5.0.0

The portfolio should work fine with your current setup.
If the dev server runs without errors, you're good to go!

To start the dev server:
   npm run dev

To build for production:
   npm run build
